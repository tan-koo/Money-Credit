# Money Credit

The entire data is made up credit card details obtained from a financial institution. There are 8950 forms in all. The work aim is divided into subgroups as order to educate behavior. ```Decision tree classification```, ```neural network classification``` and ```random forest classification``` are the procedures applied. The first step is to go over the content and delete some columns. A elbow method is then used to select the appropriate cluster number. Next, show the center point on each attribute of the subgroup for behavior learning. Finally, divide the data set into training and test groups.
